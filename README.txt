In this folder you will find the folders containing the exercises. Theese folders are named "ES[n°]*" where:

In each folder you will find:
	1_ A file named "Es[n°].ipynb" which is the jupyter notebook including the exposition of the results. 
	2_ A file named "seed.out" (most of the times) in which final values of seeds are saved.
	3_ Other necessary files explained in each (4_) README.txt file.

The folder named "PRNG" contains stuffs for the Pseudo Random Number Generator which is used almost everywhere (Please don't touch it ;) )
