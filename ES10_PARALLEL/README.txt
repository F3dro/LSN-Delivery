Legend of files and folders:

N.B. The prefix "Par" means the code/object/program is thought in order to run on multiple cores.

Code is insterted the files named "SA.cpp" and "ParSA.cpp".

Compile codes with "make" command.

Executable is labelled with ".exe" or ".pexe" (for parallel stuffs) extensions.

Execute with "./Genetic_Alg.exe" command or with "mpiexec -np [k] ParSA.pexe"
where [k] is the number of core to be used.

Clean all outputs with "./clean.sh" command.

Input file is named "input.dat".

Outputs are: "output*", "conf.partial.*", "position.*".

Folders named "CIRCLE", "SQUARE", include results for previous name-specified parameters simulatons.
