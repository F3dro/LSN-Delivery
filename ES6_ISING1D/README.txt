Legend of files:

Code is insterted the file named --> "Monte_Caro_ISING_1D.cpp" <-- .

Compile codes with "make" command.

Executable is labelled with ".exe" extension.

Execute with "./< name_executable >" command.

Clean all outputs with "./clean.sh" command.

Input file is called "input.dat".

Outputs are: "output*", "config.final".

Folders named "GB_out", "MT_out", include results for simulatons using Gibbs and Metropolis sampling.

Folder "temp0" includes (bad) simulation trying to reach 0 temperature.

Folder "equilibration" includes results for equilibrate the simulations.
