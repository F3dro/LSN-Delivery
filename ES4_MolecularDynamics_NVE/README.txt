Legend of files:

Code is insterted the file named --> "MolDyn.cpp" <-- .

Compile codes with "make" command.

Executable is labelled with ".exe" extension.

Execute with "./< name_executables >" command.

Clean all outputs with "./clean.sh" command.

Input files are called "input*" where '*' stands for possible ends.

Other files labelled with ".py" extension are python codes used for making graphs for the jupyter notebook.

Outputs are: "output*", "nconf.txt", "NoBlkk_count.txt", "frames/*".

Folders named "solid", "liquid", "gas" include results for some simulatons in the specified physic phase of the system.

Folder "images" includes some images useful for the jupyter-notebook.
