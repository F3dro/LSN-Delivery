Legend of files and folders:

Molecular dynamics stuffs are in "MOLDYN" folder.

Code is insterted the file named --> "Monte_Carlo_NVT.cpp" <-- .

Compile codes with "make" command.

Executable is labelled with ".exe" extension.

Execute with "./< name_executable >" command.

Clean all outputs with "./clean.sh" command.

Input files are named "input*" and "config.0".

Outputs are: "output*", "config.final", "frames/*".

Folders named "simu_*", "*_big", include results for previous name-specified parameters simulatons.

Jupyter notebooks named "RunMC_NVT.ipynb" and "RunMOLDYN.ipynb" are used to run new simulations for the 3 phases of Argon and Kripton.
