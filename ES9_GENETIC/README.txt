Legend of files and folders:

Code is insterted the file named --> "Genetic_Alg.cpp" <-- .

Compile codes with "make" command.

Executable is labelled with ".exe" extension.

Execute with "./Genetic_Alg.exe" command.

Clean all outputs with "./clean.sh" command.

Input file is named "input.dat".

Outputs are: "output*", "conf.partial", "position.0".

Folders named "circle", "square", "100_simu" include results for previous name-specified parameters simulatons (where "100_simu" means simulation with 100 cities).

Folder named "images" includes images useful for the jupyter-notebook.
